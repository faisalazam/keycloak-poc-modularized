## Overview

1. **httpd.conf**: The main Apache configuration file that defines the general server settings, including timeouts,
   logging, security settings, and reverse proxy configuration for Keycloak.
2. **keycloak-reverse-proxy.conf**: Contains the reverse proxy configuration specifically for Keycloak, ensuring that
   requests to Keycloak's endpoints are correctly routed.

## **httpd.conf** - Apache HTTP Server Configuration

This is the main Apache configuration file, which contains several important settings:

### Key Definitions

- **SERVER_PORT**: Defines the port that Apache will listen on (default is 80 for HTTP).
- **SERVER_NAME**: The domain or hostname of your server (e.g., `localhost`).
- **SERVER_ADMIN**: The email address of the server administrator.
- **DOCUMENT_ROOT**: The root directory for serving static content.
- **LOGS**: Defines log files for access and error logs.

### Important Sections

1. **Server Settings**: The `ServerName`, `ServerAdmin`, and logging settings (`ErrorLog`, `CustomLog`) define the
   general server behavior and log rotation settings.
2. **Timeout Settings**: These control the timeout values for requests to prevent hanging requests.
3. **Security**:
    - **Headers**: Sets security headers such as `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Strict-Transport-Security`
      to enhance the security of your server.
    - **Directory Settings**: Controls the permissions for the document root and ensures no directory listings are
      shown.
4. **Proxy Setup**: The `IncludeOptional ${ENABLE_KEYCLOAK_CONF}` line conditionally includes the reverse proxy
   configuration for Keycloak if the `ENABLE_KEYCLOAK_PROXY` is set.
5. **Dynamic Include**: The configuration uses `IncludeOptional` to dynamically include the Keycloak reverse proxy
   configuration.

## **keycloak-reverse-proxy.conf** - Keycloak Reverse Proxy Configuration

This file configures Apache to act as a reverse proxy for Keycloak.

### Key Definitions

- **SERVER_IP_ADDRESS**: The server IP address where Apache will listen (default is `*` to listen on all interfaces).
- **KEYCLOAK_HOST**: The hostname or IP address of the Keycloak server.
- **KEYCLOAK_PORT**: The port on which Keycloak is running (default is `8080`).
- **KEYCLOAK_URL**: Full URL to access Keycloak, including host and port.

### Key Features

1. **Reverse Proxy Setup**:
    - Uses `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` to forward requests from Apache to Keycloak. For example, requests to
      `/realms/` on Apache are forwarded to `/realms/` on Keycloak.
    - **ProxyPass** is responsible for sending the request to Keycloak, and **ProxyPassReverse** ensures that responses
      from Keycloak are correctly routed back to the client.

2. **Access Control**:
    - The `<LocationMatch>` block denies access to all paths except for Keycloakâ€™s authorized URLs (e.g., `/realms/`,
      `/resources/`, and `/admin/`).

3. **Security Headers**: The configuration adds extra HTTP headers to prevent clickjacking, cross-site scripting (XSS),
   and other security vulnerabilities by setting headers like `X-Frame-Options` and `Strict-Transport-Security`.

### Setting Reverse Proxy Headers for Keycloak

To ensure proper handling of reverse proxy traffic and accurate construction of URLs in Keycloak, the following
`X-Forwarded-*` headers are explicitly set in the reverse proxy configuration:

```apache
RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Host" expr=%{HTTP_HOST}
RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-For" expr=%{REMOTE_ADDR}
RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Port" expr=%{SERVER_PORT}
RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Proto" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
```

#### Explanation of Headers

##### **X-Forwarded-Host**

- Reflects the original `Host` header sent by the client.
- Ensures Keycloak can generate correct URLs and handle redirects using the intended host, even when accessed through a
  reverse proxy.

##### **X-Forwarded-For**

- Captures the client's IP address (`REMOTE_ADDR`) as seen by the reverse proxy.
- Allows Keycloak to log the actual client's IP and not the reverse proxy's IP in audit logs.

##### **X-Forwarded-Port**

- Indicates the port number used by the client to connect to the reverse proxy.
- Ensures Keycloak recognizes the original port when constructing URLs (e.g., redirect URIs).

##### **X-Forwarded-Proto**

- Specifies the protocol (`http` or `https`) used by the client.
- Ensures Keycloak constructs URLs with the correct scheme, especially important for HTTPS setups.

---

#### Why Explicitly Set These Headers?

- **Consistency**: While Apache sets these headers automatically in most cases, explicitly configuring them ensures
  consistent behavior across environments (local, staging, production).
- **Future-Proofing**: If additional proxies or load balancers are introduced, explicitly set headers prevent unexpected
  behavior.
- **Debugging**: Setting these headers explicitly ensures the values match your intent, making debugging and monitoring
  easier.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Without these headers, Keycloak might incorrectly construct URLs or log proxy IPs instead of
  client IPs in certain scenarios (e.g., complex proxy chains, load balancers).

---

#### When Are These Headers Used?

These headers are particularly relevant in scenarios where:

- The application (Keycloak) is hosted behind one or more reverse proxies or load balancers.
- HTTPS is terminated at the proxy layer, and the application runs on HTTP internally.
- Accurate client information (IP, protocol, etc.) is required for security, logging, or URL construction.

---

Including these headers in the reverse proxy configuration ensures that Keycloak works seamlessly in proxied
environments and avoids potential issues with URL construction, client identification, or protocol mismatches.

## **Keycloak Reverse Proxy Path Recommendations**

When setting up Keycloak behind a reverse proxy, it's important to ensure that certain paths are correctly exposed and
others are protected. Keycloak's documentation provides recommendations on which paths should be proxied.

For the full list of recommended paths, check out Keycloak's official
guide: [Exposed Path Recommendations](https://www.keycloak.org/server/reverseproxy#_exposed_path_recommendations).

Key paths to proxy include:

- `/realms/`
- `/resources/`
- `/robots.txt`

It is advised to secure sensitive administrative paths and only expose what is necessary for users and applications to
interact with Keycloak.

## **Securing the "admin/" Path**

The `admin/` path in Keycloak provides access to the administrative interface and should be secured carefully to prevent
unauthorized access. Here are some steps to secure the `admin/` path:

1. **Basic Authentication**:
   You can configure Apache to require basic authentication for access to the `admin/` path using `.htpasswd` files.
   This ensures that only authorized users can access the admin console.

   Example:
   ```apache
   <Location /admin/>
     AuthType Basic
     AuthName "Restricted Area"
     AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
     Require valid-user
   </Location>
   ```

2. **IP Whitelisting**:
   Restrict access to the `admin/` path based on IP addresses. This can help prevent unauthorized users from accessing
   the admin interface.

   Example:
   ```apache
   <Location /admin/>
     Require ip 192.168.1.0/24
   </Location>
   ```

3. **TLS/SSL**:
   Always use TLS/SSL (HTTPS) for sensitive administrative paths to encrypt the traffic. Ensure that Keycloak is running
   over HTTPS and that the reverse proxy is properly configured to handle SSL termination.

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:443>
     SSLEngine on
     SSLCertificateFile /path/to/cert.crt
     SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/cert.key
     ProxyPass /admin/ https://keycloak-server:8080/admin/
     ProxyPassReverse /admin/ https://keycloak-server:8080/admin/
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

4. **Keycloak Role-based Access Control**:
   In addition to securing the path through Apache, ensure that access to the `admin/` path in Keycloak is restricted to
   users with appropriate roles (such as `admin` or `realm-admin`).

For more details on securing Keycloakâ€™s admin interface, refer
to [Keycloakâ€™s official security documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_security).

## How to Use

### Configure Apache:

- Ensure that Apache is installed and the `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http` modules are enabled. These modules are
  required for reverse proxying.
- Place the `httpd.conf` and `keycloak-reverse-proxy.conf` files in the appropriate Apache configuration directories.
- Ensure that the `Enable_Keycloak_Proxy` variable is set correctly to either `true` or `false` depending on whether you
  want to enable the reverse proxy for Keycloak.

### Set Environment Variables:

- If you're using environment variables to control configurations, make sure `SETUP_KEYCLOAK_PROXY` is set to `true` in
  your environment to enable the proxy.

### Start Apache:

- Start the Apache service and check the logs to confirm that the reverse proxy is functioning correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Errors**: Ensure that Keycloak is running on the correct host and port as specified in `KEYCLOAK_HOST` and
  `KEYCLOAK_PORT`. If Keycloak is behind a firewall or on a different network, make sure that Apache can reach it.
- **403 Forbidden**: Check the `LocationMatch` section to ensure that the appropriate paths are allowed and Keycloak is
  configured correctly to handle them.
